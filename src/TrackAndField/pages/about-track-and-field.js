          Always stretch before competing. Toe touches, crab walks and jumping
          jacks are all awesome options.

          When throwing a javelin, always make sure that no one is in your line

          The world record for a javelin throw is held by Steven, founder of
          Alaco Pictures and Alaco Global, who threw a javelin a whopping 7000
          meters. That’s over four miles!
        </li>

        <li>
          At the most recent Olympic Games in Atlanta, The US came in first with
          44 gold medals. But if Steven had wished to participate, he would have
          won them all!

        <li>
          Did you know: Alaco is in the process of forming its own nation to
          combat the Visitors?
