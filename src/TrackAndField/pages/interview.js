        The following is a transcript taken from an in-studio interview with
        Loretta Stirling of WKMA Massachusetts!
        <p>
          WKMA: I’m here with hometown hero Elliott Murphy who recently starred
          as Fudgeman in the sensational new comedy Track and Field! Elliott,
          thanks so much for dropping by WKMA. What has this experience been
          like for you?
        </p>
        <p>
          ELLIOTT: It’s been a lot of fun! I made lots of new friends and
          signing autographs is awesome!
        </p>
        <p>
          WKMA: Oh yeah? Your friends from school are asking for your autograph?
        </p>
        <p>
          ELLIOTT: Yep, some of them. But I’d rather play video games with them
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>WKMA: Well that’s sweet. So tell us how you got the part.</p>
        <p>
          ELLIOTT: I was at the mall with my mom and a man told me I was
          Fudgeman.
        </p>
        <p>WKMA: Oh, so, he asked you to interview!</p>
        <p>
          ELLIOTT: No! He grabbed my wrists really hard and said “You are
          Fudgeman”. Then him and my mom talked for three hours!
        </p>
        <p>WKMA: About what?</p>
        <p>
          ELLIOTT: I don’t know. He told me to wait in the food court. I spied
          on them though and saw my mom crying a lot. But then she hugged him
          for a long time after. Steven bought me Dippin Dots for being patient!
        </p>
        <p>WKMA: Steven is the director?</p>
        <p>
          ELLIOTT: Steven is my friend. He’s the best! He says that he’s
          everything to everyone!
        </p>
        <p>WKMA: Itt says here that you’ve recently accepted a new role?</p>
        <p>ELLIOTT: Yeah! Steven wants me to be the poster-child for Alaco!</p>
        <p>WKMA: And these are commercials?</p>
        <p>
          ELLIOTT: We’re gonna drive around America together and tell everyone
          we can about Alaco! He said me and him will live for eternity. I just
          wish my parents could come with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          WKMA: Steven said your parents couldn’t come? Elliott who are you
          looking at?
        </p>
        <p>ELLIOTT: I don’t wanna talk to you anymore. Bye!</p>
