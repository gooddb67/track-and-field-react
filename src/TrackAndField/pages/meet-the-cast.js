        Steven (as himself) is an actor, philanthropist, entrepreneur, healer,
        athlete, physicist and more. Star of countless films for Alaco - of
        which he is President and CEO - Steven has created a new style of acting
        entitled radical feeling, in which through the power of touch, he can
        experience any emotion. Steven teaches this acting style exclusively at
        Alaco headquarters and its Summer Camp in The Mohave Desert. When he’s
        not teaching, Steven is developing new and exciting products for Alaco,
        in order to raise the requisite funds for what is to come. Fun fact
        about Steven: He is a sworn enemy of the Visitors and will cease their
        rise with the power of the Quadraform. Steven’s best friend is a tie
        between Fudgeman and the Angel Of The Red Wood, but he loves all who
        come to see the blinding lights of his majesty. Steven is an avid poet
        who composes psalm and song to the delight of all. Steven lives in Los
        Angeles with his dog Bonezy, his son Tate, and his 400 wives. Did you
        know: Steven was named a person of interest in the murder of JonBenét
        Ramsey? <br />
